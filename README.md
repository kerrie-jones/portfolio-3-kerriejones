# Portfolio Project 3 Kerrie Jones
This application gleans information from a dataset in an easy and convenient manner.
The Google Sheets dataset is created from Google Forms data. These forms are filled out by students before they begin their practical element of a horsemanship course. Information such as name, contact, emergency contact, any medical declarations, and level of experience is included on the form. 
The teachers on the course can use this application to find specific information more conveniently than manually searching through all the forms.

# Testing
This project has been manually tested by:
* passing code through a PEP8 linter and ensuring there are no signifigant errors
* Checked validation by entering number where letters should be and vice versa and tried entering incorrect staff number length

## Validator Testing
* PEP8 
## Bugs
### Solved Bugs
* when name and staff number were validated if there was an error both needed to be inputted again. Corrected this by separating validation forboth inputs.
